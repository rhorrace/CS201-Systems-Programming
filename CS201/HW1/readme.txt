Horrace, Robert CS201

This program is designed to be a maze program.
The program is supposed to display a maze, have the solution,
and have the player go through the maze using the wall 
follower algorithm.

This program was supposed to be complete, it isn't complete.
This program is supposed read from one of the three files
provided and place the variables in the and place the maze in
a multidimensional array. The program then displays the maze
by using X's and 0's(as in zeros). It is supposed to check for walls
and display what is at the front,back,left, and right of the current 
position.
Then, it is supposed to ask the user if they want to go left,right,up,or down
and move the position if possible. If it is not possible to move the position,
the program will prompt the user again for up,down,keft or right.
If the user's position reaches the finish, the program will congratulate the
user and aks the user if they want to do a maze again.

This program, regrettably isn't complete. It currently only reads from a file
and displays a maze. There is a function that checks for walls, but it doesn't
fully work yet.
